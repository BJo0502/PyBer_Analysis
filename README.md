# Module 5: PyBer with Matplotlib

## Overview of the analysis
In our new role as a data analyst with PyBer rideshare company we are tasked with conducting analysis to help the company improve access to rideshare services and to determine affordability in underserved communities. Our main task is to examine the total weekly fares by city type which will ultimately be used by PyBer decision makes in the future.

## Results

Based on our analysis of PyBer data we can see that there are discrepancies in cost and access to rideshare services. Not only is the average fare per ride cheaper, but access to a driver is also significantly more convenient for those living in an urban city. Assuming a rider in a rural city can access a driver, they will be paying approximately $10 more per ride than an urban rider would. On the other hand, PyBer drivers working in rural cities are making over 3x the amount that our urban drivers make. There is less driver competition, and the driver to rides ratio is significantly more in the rural driverâ€™s favor than in comparison to both the suburban and urban drivers.

After reviewing the PyBer data it appears there is likely some room for improvement; however, my recommendation would be to gather some more data prior to making any decisions. Currently, it appears that access to drivers is significantly limited in the rural communities; however, if we consider driver count per total population this may in fact not be the case at all. It would also be helpful to examine the geographical distribution of our PyBer drivers and the average ride distance. If our rural drivers are driving 3x the distance per ride, that would help to explain why the average cost per driver is so much higher. On the other hand, an urban driver could travel a fraction of the distance, but given the average ride time and assuming traffic delays, our urban fares may be too low. Lastly, the line graph provides some additional insights regarding seasonality and ride fares by city type. It would be worth gathering more data to determine if there are seasonality trends that we could consider. Perhaps there is an opportunity to increase fare rates during the holiday season that PyBer can capitalize on to offset lowering fares elsewhere to increase total rides.
