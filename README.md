# Module 5: PyBer with Matplotlib

## Overview of the analysis
In our new role as a data analyst with PyBer rideshare company we are tasked with conducting analysis to help the company improve access to rideshare services and to determine affordability in underserved communities. Our main task is to examine the total weekly fares by city type which will ultimately be used by PyBer decision makes in the future.

## Results

Based on our analysis of PyBer data we can see that there are discrepancies in cost and access to rideshare services. Not only is the average fare per ride cheaper, but access to a driver is also significantly more convenient for those living in an urban city. Assuming a rider in a rural city can access a driver, they will be paying approximately $10 more per ride than an urban rider would. On the other hand, PyBer drivers working in rural cities are making over 3x the amount that our urban drivers make. There is less driver competition, and the driver to rides ratio is significantly more in the rural driverâ€™s favor than in comparison to both the suburban and urban drivers.
